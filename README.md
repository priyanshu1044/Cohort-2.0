# Serverless with Cloudflare Workers

## Challenges with Serverless Architecture

Serverless architecture, while offering numerous benefits, also presents certain challenges:

1. **Cost-effectiveness at Scale:** Serverless can become more expensive as the scale of operations increases.
2. **Cold Start Problem:** Serverless functions may experience latency due to the "cold start" problem, where a function takes longer to execute if it hasn't been used recently.

## Popular Serverless Providers

Several providers offer serverless computing services:

1. AWS Lambda
2. Google Cloud Functions
3. Azure Functions
4. Cloudflare Workers

## Project Focus: Cloudflare Workers

In this project, we will be utilizing Cloudflare Workers for the following:

1. Deploying our serverless functions in the cloud.
2. Using Hono for routing and managing our serverless functions.
