# 🚀 Monorepo Example with TurboRepo

Welcome to the Monorepo example using TurboRepo. This README provides an overview of the benefits of monorepos, introduces common monorepo frameworks in Node.js, and explains the difference between build systems, build system orchestrators, and monorepo frameworks. Additionally, it outlines how to initialize a simple Turborepo.

## 🌟 Why Monorepos?

### 1. 🔄 Shared Code Reuse
- Monorepos facilitate code reuse across different parts of your project, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

### 2. 🤝 Enhanced Collaboration
- With a single repository, team collaboration is streamlined, making it easier to coordinate changes and manage dependencies.

### 3. ⚡ Optimized Builds and CI/CD
- Tools like TurboRepo offer smart caching and task execution strategies that significantly reduce build and testing times.

### 4. 🛠️ Centralized Tooling and Configuration
- Managing build tools, linters, formatters, and other configurations is simpler in a monorepo, as you can use a single set of tools for the entire project.

## 📚 Common Monorepo Frameworks in Node.js

- **Lerna**: [lerna.js.org](https://lerna.js.org/)
- **Nx**: [github.com/nrwl/nx](https://github.com/nrwl/nx)
- **Turborepo**: [turbo.build](https://turbo.build/) (Not exactly a monorepo framework but a build system orchestrator)
- **Yarn/npm Workspaces**: [classic.yarnpkg.com](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/)

## 🛠️ Build System vs. Build System Orchestrator vs. Monorepo Framework

### Build System
A build system automates the process of transforming source code into executable code. For JavaScript and TypeScript projects, this can include:
- Transpilation (e.g., TS to JS)
- Bundling (combining multiple files)
- Minification (reducing file size)
- Running tests
- Linting
- Deploying applications

### Build System Orchestrator
A build system orchestrator like TurboRepo does not directly perform tasks such as transpilation or bundling. Instead, it defines and manages tasks that call other tools (the actual build systems) to perform these actions. 

### Monorepo Framework
A monorepo framework provides tools and conventions for managing multiple packages or applications within a single repository. This includes dependency management and workspace configuration.

## 🏎️ Turborepo as a Build System Orchestrator

TurboRepo is a build system orchestrator with key features that include:

### 📦 Caching
- TurboRepo caches task outputs, allowing it to skip re-execution and use cached results if inputs haven't changed. This speeds up build times, especially in CI environments.

### ⚙️ Parallelization
- TurboRepo can run independent tasks in parallel, efficiently using machine resources and reducing the overall time needed for project tasks.

### 🕸️ Dependency Graph Awareness
- TurboRepo understands the dependency graph of your monorepo, ensuring tasks are run in the correct order based on package dependencies.

## 🛠️ Initialize a Simple Turborepo

To initialize a simple Turborepo, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-turbo@latest
```
