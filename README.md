PostgreSQL is a highly stable database backed by more than 20 years of development by the open-source community. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages).

### Prisma ORM

Prisma helps app developers build faster and make fewer errors with an open source ORM for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite. It provides a clean and type-safe API for submitting database queries.
